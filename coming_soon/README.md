# Coming Soon

Hey, you've got to the end of the book, and you're wondering: what happened to the documentation on "*Insert particular feature here*"?

Well, its on its way. In future releases, we'll be looking at:
* Checkin (Administration and kiosks)
* Task lists for groups
* Instructions on how to edit field labels and text in the User Interface
* Expand the Planning for OneBody section to include:
    - Some cheat sheets you can use with your members
    - An example of a plan for implementation
    - How to handle personal data updates.



    Tim, thought about putting instructions in on how to edit the yml files.
