# Planning for OneBody

First and foremost, OneBody is community software. People were made to be in connection with each other (admittedly some more than others!). We think OneBody will help you to create relationship, connection, and community in your church.

If you're excited about that, read on.

Having said that, how do you go about implementing something like OneBody? Well...

####Some "Gets" for a successful implementation

**Get Prayer**.

Make sure you've got others who can support you in prayer as you go about your work.

**Get a team**.

You can't go it alone, even if you're the one doing the bulk of the work. Having support and the faith community around you is essential.

**Get the Leadership Team on board**.

Studies show that software implementations that have senior support are more likely to succeed.

**Get a Strategy.**

It doesn't have to be big, but it should articulate why you want OneBody in your church.

**Get a plan**.

Those who fail to plan, plan to fail.


#### Some Do's along the way....

**Do Communicate**

The way you present OneBody in your congregation is key to its success. Think of one or two key messages you'd like folks to remember, and keep saying them.

** Do turn on features**.

OneBody is best when sharing features - friends, photos, verses & documents - are switched *on*.

** Do think about [security](/planning_for_installation/understanding_security_roles_and_users.html)**.

Keeping people safe online is important.

So what sort of skills/roles would be useful when you put together a team to implement?

Answer: All sorts! The exact makeup of your team will vary, but consider the following:

1. Analyst - to help you map your existing processes to OneBody features
2. Communicators - to "Do Communicate"
3. Pray-ers - Anything that's not presented before God will not go well :)
4. A member of your church staff - to help familiarise this important group of people with OneBody
5. Change agents. You probably know these people already - because they are the ones who like to keep changing things! They are key allies in broadcasting the OneBody message.
5. ... and some IT support probably wouldn't go amiss.
