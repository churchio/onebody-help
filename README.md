# Introduction

Hi! We're glad you're here reading the user documentation.

> <small> Not looking for this? Try [install docs](https://github.com/churchio/onebody/wiki/Installation) or [the wiki](https://github.com/churchio/onebody/wiki).</small>

If you're a member of a OneBody community and want to know more about how it works, swing over to [Getting Started](../getting_started/README.html).

If you're planning a OneBody production environment for your church, we recommend you read the [Planning for OneBody](../planning_for_installation/README.html) section.

If you're wanting to get OneBody up and running quickly in a non-production environment (e.g. for evaluation), head over to [Getting Started - for Administrators](../getting_started/for-administrators.html). This will allow you to configure a system you can look at with minimal setup.


### Useful things to know
Throughout the guides, we use the term "member", instead of person, or user. We think the term member more accurately captures our community focus.

We've used some standard terms throughout these guides. You'll find them in the [glossary](../GLOSSARY.html).

If you'd like to contact us, send a message via  [IRC](https://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=#church.io) or our [Google Group](http://groups.google.com/group/churchio). Feedback is always welcome.

Finally, we've assumed that you have:
* a modern web browser installed (Firefox, Chrome, or Safari)
* a basic knowledge of how to use the internet
* the ability to upload and download files using a web browser
* the ability to use a web browser to search and browse for things
* an available installation of OneBody

... because we won't be covering that in these guides.
