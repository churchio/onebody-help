From the homepage you can share pictures, bible verses and post group messages.

### Sharing Pictures
To share a picture, first you need to create an album. You can choose to share the album with the community, or just your friends.

Once you have saved the album, **Select Photo** will upload more. Its that easy.

### Sharing Bible Verses
Hit the Bible Verse icon to share a verse. You'll be prompted to add your verse, then you'll see:

You can also add a comment to the verse, and your friends can comment as well.
