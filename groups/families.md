# Families

As well as individual member data, OneBody also features family grouping. Many features of OneBody make use of the family unit; Attendance, Check-in, Online Directory, and visibilty are just examples.

A family in the OneBody sense is a household, or all people living at one address that share the same family roof. As examples:

* An individual
* Two individuals
* A married couple
* Parent(s) and child(ren)
* Parents, children and extended family


## Looking after Families
