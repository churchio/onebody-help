#Glossary

#### CSV

Comma Separated Values file commonly used for transfering tabular data. [See here.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values)

#### member

A member of your community. We use the term "member" throughout the guides, instead of person, or user. We think the term member more accurately captures our community focus.

Note: a community member does not necessarily have to be someone who is officially a member of your church or organization -- anyone can join your community site as long as you allow them.
