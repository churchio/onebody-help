# Looking after People

>**info** This page assumes you have administrative rights for *people*.

Unless you have a small congregation, you will probably want to devolve some responsibility for managing people records to others in your church. This chapter provides some help to make this happen.

### Adding People Manually
In addition to the generally available fields, the profile supports a number of fields that are designated for adminstrative use.

| Field | Tab |Description |
| -- | -- | -- |
| Child | Basics | If a member is designated as a child, then their profile will automatically be Hidden. |
| Can Sign in | Visibility | Allows a user to sign in. Useful if you wish to pre-load records but prevent signin to the site until a specified time. |
| Visible to everyone | Visibility | Controls whether this person will be visible to regular users of the site. |
| Visible on printed directory | Visibility | Controls whether a record will appear in the PDF version of the directory. |
| Full Access | Visibility | If selected, a user will have full access to the site, otherwise the profile will be restricted when the user signs in. |

The *Send a password setup email to this user* button automatically generates a verification email to the users email address.

You can also specify [options](../administration/settings.html#members) for how member personal data updates should be handled.

### Deleting People

You can also remove to remove people records from OneBody. Members with the "Edit Profiles" security role will be able to delete people records.

To remove a person record, access the family, and select the "delete" icon.

Deletion of people is a serious business. So,to prevent accidental deletion, when you delete people from a family, an administrator needs to approve the deletion from the database.

When you hit the admin dashboard, you'll see that the Deleted person metric now has something to do!

![Delete a person](../img/admin/admin-people-7.png)

The Deleted People Screen will then appear.


Select the person, and then use the green **Undelete selected people** button to restore the person record.

The Purge button will officially remove the selected person from the database. Select the "Purge family when empty" select box to also delete any empty family records.

### Roles

The roles tab contains check boxes to note a members' designation. Roles selected here will appear at the top of the profile and in the directory pages.

There are four predefined roles: Member, Staff, Elder, and Deacon. You can enable the custom type through the [settings page](../administration/settings.html#members). Hit the dropdown list to create your custom role.
